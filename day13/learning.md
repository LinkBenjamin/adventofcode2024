Today's learning is that I don't know enough linear algebra to solve these kinds of problems quickly.

I looked up a solution [here](https://github.com/TurtleSmoke/Advent-of-Code/blob/main/2024/day_13/main.py) and was blown away with how simple he made it... I've kept his solution in [alt.py](alt.py)

At first I thought maybe it was cheating to offload all the math to a library like that, but... is it really?  If you (a) know that this will solve the problem and (b) know how to set it up correctly, why not use it?
